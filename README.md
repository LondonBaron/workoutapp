jb personal project to learn various code, design and function
This is my first attempt to create an app, initially on web accessed via phone, to record a users wieght training workout.  
I am looking to extend it out to allow a "ghost" view of exercises selected to inform the user of prev records as the exercise is selected.
I want to populate a backend myseql database to provide persistance.
I would like to develop this further later to be a tru phone app for android.
I will then develop the app to allow the user to simply scan code on machines to select, or to make use of RFID for quick selection.
The final project would allow some data to be sent to the app for inclusion from various other user apps including a bluetooth scales and myfitness pal, hopefully also with some data from a user watch for heart rate and step data.
